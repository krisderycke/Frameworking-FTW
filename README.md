## Bootstrap: 
I choose Bootstrap 4 as my go-to framework. 
Mostly because it is very well known and widely used by thousands of developers, 
which makes it *"easier"* to get an answer to some kind of problem.

====

The first moments it was kind of an abstract thing, this framework. but as time went by
i started realizing how powerful a framework kan be, if used correctly.
I am, however, not convinced using only a framework is a good way to build a website.
CSS and Bootstrap should go hand in hand.
